Specialty pizzas include a version with jalapeños and another with spicy ranch sauce and chorizo, as the chain continues to develop strategies that cultivate Latino customers.","Dallas, Texas",4.4e+07,3.5,104,NA,445000,2013,NA
"Jollibee","Think of Jollibee as the McDonald’s of the Philippines. Tony Tan Cakiong started his quickservice concept, which has spread throughout that archipelago nation and beyond, in 1975 as an ice cream parlor, soon adding burgers and sandwiches. The chain opened it first U.S. unit almost a quarter century later in Daly City, California. Known particularly for children’s parties, restaurants provide everything from special food to invitations, goodie bags and “Jollitown gang” entertainment. The U.S. stores, most targeted to Filipino immigrant neighborhoods, feature burgers and chicken and a separate breakfast menu and often serve 24/7. Jollibee food has some Filipino touches such as rice noodles and a fiery chili-powdered fried chicken. Parent company Jollibee Foods Corp. is traded on the Philippines Stock Exchange. Expansion to nearly 900 stores throughout the world (about 25 of those are in the U.S.) has come through franchising.","City of Industry, Calif.",3.5e+07,2.9,27,NA,1400000,2013,NA
"PDQ","If Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out Burger had a love child, it might look like PDQ—an acronym that most folks associate with Pretty Darn Quick but, in this case, stands for People Dedicated to Quality. The double entendre is apt.","Tampa, Fla.",28500000,280,18,260,2500000,2014,"Yes"
"BurgerFi","The highest-ranking of the six burger concepts on the list, BurgerFi (short for “Burgerfication of the Nation”) traces its roots to the casual side of fast casual. A Florida gastropub called The Office had a hit with an Angus burger. Proprietor John Rosatti decided to build a concept around it, carrying over the use of ingredients perceived as natural and high quality. BurgerFi is a segment pioneer in offering wines and craft beers, another reflection of its parentage. To stay ahead of the pack, BurgerFi launched a top-to-bottom brand exploration this year. ","North Palm Beach, Fla.",44500000,178.1,33,175,2e+06,2014,"Yes"
"Hakkasan","Branches of this upscale Asian restaurant and celebrity hangout, a tonier half-sibling to the Wagamama noodle chain, probably won’t be opening between an Applebee’s and a Chili’s on Average Town’s restaurant row. This is not one for the mainstream. The swank factor of the 11,000-square-foot concept makes it a natural for places that wink at indulgence, a la Miami, Las Vegas and New York City. The concept’s parent bought a nightclub operation early in 2014, opening up new expansion opportunities, particularly in hotels and casinos.",NA,3.2e+07,100,5,66.7,8e+06,2014,"No"
"Del Frisco’s Grille","Who says fine dining is passe? It’s just loosening up so six-figure earners won’t feel they’re back in the dark-wood cathedrals where Dad could order something predictable from a menu of no surprises. The Grille is a casual riff on the high-end Del Frisco’s Double Eagle concept, but don’t expect to find games on the flat screens and platters of wings. There’s just more latitude in the upscale ambience and food, with an emphasis on shareable and sampling options. Even Dad would like the horseshoe bar. ","Southlake, Texas",44100000,83.9,11,120,5500000,2014,"No"
"Umami Burger","Do not—repeat, do not—read this entry aloud. The mere mention of Umami Burger can trigger a stampede among the Yelp crowd. The catnip is a secret house sauce that’s blended into the hand-formed, ground-on-premise burgers, adding a pinch of Japanese mysticism to the fast-casual chain’s specialty. It supposedly packs umami, a sixth, indeterminate taste in Asian lore. A hip ambience also is an intended lure for the dressed-in-black set.  ","Los Angeles, Calif.",37400000,70,22,57.1,2100000,2014,"No"
"Bareburger","Chipotle founder Steve Ells sees an incompatibility between franchising and his progressive intentions as an operator, but Bareburger entrepreneur Euripedes Pelekanos doesn’t suffer those qualms in his stab at an enlightened fast-casual startup. Despite the concept’s reliance on natural, organic and exotic ingredients, including meats, he’s packing the pipeline with new stores; 13 more are set to open this year. The formula calls for each new building to be built with a commitment to sustainability.","Long Island City, N.Y.",33400000,62.9,17,70,2500000,2014,"Yes"
"Veggie Grill","If mainstream consumers would try Veggie Grill’s meatless signatures, they’d likely be hooked. Or so management is betting in developing the concept as a flavor craver’s alternative to conventional (read: fat-reliant) fast-food joints. They insist their meat replacements are as tasty and chewy as the real thing. Still, preconceptions can be stubborn; can meat lovers be coaxed to try something labeled veggie? The breadth of Veggie Grill’s appeal could depend on a flexivore’s true flexibility. ","Westlake Village, Calif.",26600000,60.7,22,46.7,1400000,2014,"No"
"Bowlmor Lanes","In-store entertainment is a more common feature among this year’s Future 50 chains than it has been in the past, ranging from celebrity-watching (Hakkasan, No. 3) to games steeped in nostalgia, such as bowling. One of two alley operators on the list (including Pinstripes, No. 12), Bowlmor stresses that it’s as much a restaurant, sports bar and arcade as it is a place to knock down pins. And don’t forget the transformation late at night into an activities-rich nightclub, complete with music and dancing.","New York City, N.Y.",37600000,49.2,14,100,3600000,2014,"No"
"Lime Fresh Mexican Grill","Last year, after diversifying into a bunch of concepts, Ruby Tuesday decided to back away from all but one of the ventures. Lime Fresh was just too much of a gem to sell. With an emphasis on local, natural ingredients, custom-prepared as the guest watches, the brand is going mano a mano with Chipotle on the food-with-a-difference front. Like Chipotle, Lime Fresh aims for younger, more socially and environmentally conscious customers, but holds its own with business professionals and families.","Maryville, Texas",42500000,47.2,27,22.7,1700000,2014,"Yes"
"Tender Greens","High-end chefs sometimes guarantee they’ll get enough fresh produce by partnering with farmers to have it grown specifically for them. Ditto for Tender Greens, a fast-casual salad specialist whose co-owners include a grower in California. Other supplies come from farmers markets. The parallels don’t end there. Each unit has an executive chef, many with bragging rights about where they’ve cooked previously. The emphasis is on all-natural salads and grilled entrees, served in a modern setting. ","Culver City, Calif.",40500000,44.6,12,33.3,3900000,2014,"No"
"PepperJax Grill","Long before Gary Rohwer started PepperJax Grill, he patented a way to produce the thinly sliced, fast-cooking beef that’s routinely used today for Philly cheesesteak, Italian beef and French dip sandwiches. Rohwer sold the rights but kept an eye on the restaurant business, noticing the lack of a better-cheesesteak concept among the pack of fast-casual startups. So he fired up PepperJax, whose fresh ingredients include house-developed breads and sauces. Patrons spec their orders to whomever cooks their meal.","Omaha, Neb.",31200000,44.4,34,88.9,1200000,2014,"No"
"Pinstripes","Another mash-up of game playing and dining, Pinstripes enjoys a booming group business, from holiday parties to business meetings and even weddings. The concept touts itself as a source of sophisticated fun for white-collar consumers who want their night out to encompass more than just a meal and some drinks. Recreation options include bowling and bocce. A 30,000-square-foot footprint leaves ample space for private rooms along with the alleys. Total capacity is 600 people.","Northbrook, Ill.",30800000,42.6,6,50,6200000,2014,"No"
"Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe","Taziki’s was born in 1998 following a European vacation founder Keith Richards (not that Keith Richards) took with his family. The fast casual targets women and families with its healthy spin on traditional Greek food in the form of salads, gyros and sandwiches and soups. It also boasts strong ties to the community, taking part in local events and fundraisers and sharing the results via its active social media channels. Two years ago, Jim Keet, a restaurant vet and former Wendy’s franchisee, came on as CEO to help Taziki’s grow its franchise business; his sons own and operate several Taziki’s in Arkansas.","Birmingham, Ala.",28800000,41.9,31,55,1100000,2014,"Yes"
"The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co.","A Florida startup hoping to hook mainstream America on a regional specialty, OBWB asserts that it’s the authentic alternative to segmentmates such as Einstein Bros. or Dunkin’ Donuts. The claim arises from the treatment system installed in every store to replicate the water used in what purists see as the one true bagel, the chewy variety found in New York City. Glass partitions let customers watch as the bagels are made with “Brooklynized” water.","Boca Raton, Fla.",30500000,38.6,19,35.7,1900000,2014,"Yes"
"16 handles","The sole fro-yo concept on the list, 16 Handles is named for the number of self-serve flavors—from simple Blackberry to Blood Orange Tart—on offer at any time. To stand out in a still-saturated segment, it touts certified-kosher ingredients and earth-friendly cups and spoons. Each store also vows to plant 16 trees every day. Upping the cool factor, 16 Handles was reportedly one of the first brands to leverage Snapchat’s disappearing messages. By sending coupons that self-destruct in a few seconds, 16 Handles earned Mashable’s 2013 Rising Star award for digital marketing.","New York City, N.Y.",32400000,37.9,43,38.7,875000,2014,"Yes"
"Bobby’s Burger Palace","Of all the celebrity chefs to jump on the better-burger bandwagon in the last decade, only Bobby Flay has made an empire of it. Burger names are inspired by his travels across the U.S., and customers are encouraged to “get crunchified,” a term Flay trademarked that means adding a layer of potato chips. The rest of the menu is limited (fries, onion rings and so on), except for the 13 varieties of milkshakes, with and without booze.","New York City, N.Y.",38600000,36.9,17,41.7,2700000,2014,"No"
"Marlow’s Tavern","Seasonal dishes, grilled ahi tuna and creme brulee are on tap at these neighborhood gastropubs, clustered in the Atlanta area with offshoots in Orlando. But don’t let the fancy food fool you. The partners, collectively, have more than 129 years of experience at chain operations, including Darden, Boston Market and TGI Fridays, which may be just what it takes to reach their goal of 25 Marlow’s by 2015.","Atlanta, Ga.",4.1e+07,34,13,18.2,3400000,2014,"No"
"Chop't Creative Salad Company","“Build it and they will come,” is not the strategy employed at this omnipresent customizable salad and wraps concept. Its young founders have made a concerted effort since launching in 2001 to cultivate salad fans, beyond the expected vegan and vegetarian clientele, willing to pay $10 for a healthy meal. Early on, they developed “recruiting salads,” Crain’s New York Business reports, with unsaladlike ingredients such as steak and onion rings, to lure Average Joes. Now people are lining up outside for make-your-own bowls or rotating “destination salads” (signatures that change every 60 days). And the “Vegan tastes better” messaging now unabashedly tops the website and in-store signage. For those who need still more coaxing, floor-to-ceiling windows let passersby catch a glimpse of crew members chopping greens at breakneck speed with curved mezzaluna-style knives.","New York City, N.Y.",4.4e+07,33.3,24,26.3,2e+06,2014,"No"
"Native Foods Café","Co-owners Daniel Dolan and wife Andrea McGinty (founder of the It’s Just Lunch dating service) are showing they’re serious about mainstreaming this vegan concept, known for clothing housemade tempeh, seitan and tofu in inexpensive, familiar dishes such as meatball subs and bacon cheeseburgers. In the past three years, they’ve secured $25 million in funding, hired former Chipotle CFO John Miller and moved their headquarters to a Chicago hub in the center of the country. As Dolan, who purchased the chain with McGinty in 2009, told Crain’s Chicago Business in April, “In the second half of the year, we’ll open one [restaurant] about every three weeks, and by January, we’ll start opening two a month.”","Chicago, Ill.",33200000,30.2,17,21.4,2100000,2014,"No"
"Roti Mediterranean Grill","When Bill Post, former president of Levy Restaurants (operator of Chicago’s Spiaggia, Wolfgang Puck Grand Cafe at Disneyworld and numerous stadium foodservice operations) decided to strike out on his own, he saw a gap—and an opportunity—in Mediterranean. With a clear nod to the Chipotle model, customers at fast-casual Roti move down the line topping salads, wraps or rice plates with shawarma (simply labeled chicken, steak or salmon), hummus, couscous, eggplant, olives, feta cheese, tahini or five other sauces. Prominent signage uses simple, close-up photography to convey the message of naturally raised, organic fresh ingredients.","Chicago, Ill.",2.7e+07,29.8,20,33.3,1500000,2014,"No"
"Freshii","Freshii’s angle is simple: Its “Eat. Energize.” tagline is delivered largely to a lunchtime crowd through healthy salads, soups, wraps and bowls as well as cold-pressed juices and smoothies. The customizable food is dished Chipotle-style, natch. Adding in overseas units, Freshii operates more than 75 locations in eight countries. But Freshii’s commitment to health isn’t just a slogan. Last fall, CEO Matthew Corrin, who founded the company in Toronto nine years ago when he was 23 years old, partnered with an innovation firm to launch Fresh Startups. Corrin will take an active role coaching applicants in the incubator-style program that promises to seed health and wellness-focused technology businesses, and allow them to test ideas on Freshii customers.","Chicago, Ill.",31600000,29,42,44.8,890000,2014,"No"
"Sharky’s Woodfired Mexican Grill","One blogger pegs Sharky’s this way: “Think Chipotle, but with more stuff on the menu, organic ingredients and real plates.” Sharky’s stands out for a few more reasons: As its name suggests, stone wood-fired ovens are used to cook many of the 40-some menu items. Beyond burritos and rice bowls, there are pizzas, enchiladas, salads and more. Adult beverages are a focus, and the decor leans more casual than fast with leather booths that invite lingering. Expansion plans focus on Western states.","Westlake Village, Calif.",33600000,25.4,21,10.5,1600000,2014,"No"
"Barcelona Restaurant & Wine Bar","The vision for this upscale casual is laid out clearly in the forward of its cookbook: “Yankee Connecticut might be the last place you’d expect a tapas bar and restaurant to be successful, but [the owners] have proved that tasty, quickly prepared Spanish-inspired food … can be a hit anywhere.” That was five years and four locations ago. Here, “chef-driven” means  that about a third of the menu is tailored by the chef at each location. And chefs make face time with guests a priority with in-house cooking classes.","Norwalk, Conn.",33800000,25.2,9,50,4500000,2014,"No"
"Elevation Burger","Elevation Burger is a study of contrasts. A recent Facebook promotion playfully pitted “beefies” against “veggies,” with the winner to get free burgers (beef or veggie) for a year. To help reach its goal of 20 new units this year, the better-burger chain tapped Rick Altizer, a former regional vice president and general manager for McDonald’s, to be CEO this spring, when founder Hans Hess slid over to board chairman—at the tender age of 42. Don’t mistake its organic ingredients for low calorie. On the menu: a 10-patty burger that clocks in at 1,950 calories.<U+200B>","Arlington, Va.",3e+07,25,32,10.3,980000,2014,"Yes"
"MacKenzie River Pizza Co.","Despite its rustic decor, Montanans didn’t quite know what to make of MacKenzie River Pizza Co. when it debuted in 1993, but were quick to embrace decidedly not-down-home pizza toppings such as zucchini, feta and jerk chicken. In 2007, Glacier Restaurant Group, led by former CKE CEO William Foley, bought a number of MacKenzie locations. Glacier’s units now are adopting an expanded menu with burgers, steak and pub food as well as a new name: MacKenzie River Pizza, Grill and Pub.","Whitefish, Mont.",25700000,22.9,19,18.8,1400000,2014,"Yes"
"Bob’s Steak & Chop House","This Dallas institution, that still enforces a business-casual dress code, finally has shaken off its scandalous past, which included a bankruptcy filing and felony theft indictment of founder Bob Sambol. It has since grown, with a high-profile debut at the $268 million Omni Nashville Hotel (Omni owns a 50 percent stake in the brand), selling 6,700 steaks in the first 90 days. Sambol also has rebounded, now helping would-be restaurateurs as a member of the judging panel at incubator Trinity Groves.","Dallas, Texas",30600000,22.4,10,42.9,3600000,2014,"Yes"
"Pita Jungle","Pita Jungle is a full-service restaurant with a menu that blends Middle Eastern classics, such as dolmades and baba ghanoush, with mainstream healthy and vegetarian fare that has a Mediterranean twist. What sets it apart is a creative vibe that attracts both families and millennials. Units are filled with local artwork in step with Pita Jungle’s tagline: “The art of eating healthy.” The chain, started in Arizona by three Arizona State University grads 20 years ago, has recently expanded into California. ","Scottsdale, Ariz.",30600000,22.4,20,17.6,1700000,2014,"Yes"
"Boloco","Burritos accented with Thai, Cajun, Indian and Mexican flavors draw eaters to Boloco. To increase its healthy offerings, the chain recently expanded its line of salads and bowls, adding quinoa and kale. Eco-consciousness is key to the concept’s mission, and most stores are green-certified. They tout reclaimed materials, compostable cups and bowls, recycling programs and humanely raised meat. Millennials are Boloco’s target audience and units often are located near college campuses.","Boston, Mass.",26700000,22.1,23,15,1200000,2014,"Yes"
"Crave","Parent company Kaskaid Hospitality stirred many of today’s hot trends into Crave, including an exhibition kitchen with wood-fired pizza oven, sushi bar and glass-enclosed wine room. The extensive menu also hits several trend buttons, with flatbreads, sliders, sushi rolls and a roster of gluten-free choices. The bulk of business is done in the evening, when some locations boast a DJ or live music. Still, Crave makes an effort to be family-friendly, with units frequently built inside or next to shopping malls and flexible dine-in, takeout and offsite catering options.","Bloomington, Minn.",3e+07,20,9,12.5,3500000,2014,"No"
"Becks Prime","When it launched in 1985, Becks Prime was well ahead of the better-burger boom.  Today, onsite cooks still grind and form the burgers daily and grill them over mesquite coals. Hand-scooped milkshakes, hot dogs, salads and premium chicken sandwiches round out the menu. The chain is cautious about growth, expanding slowly and steadily through Texas. The three founders continue to be involved in day-to-day operations, and a couple of their kids have joined the company. ","Houston, Texas",25700000,19.5,15,15.4,1800000,2014,"No"
"Fadó Irish Pub & Restaurant","Fadó bills itself as “a different kind of Irish pub.” While it has tons of beers and large-screen TVs, it’s as much a gastropub as a sports bar. The decor features authentic handcrafts from Ireland, and interiors vary by location. The menu elevates pub grub with on-trend, made-from-scratch items such as Garden Beets and Hummus Sandwich and Slow Roasted Pork Belly with cider reduction. Cocktails, wine and premium spirits attract a more diverse crowd. ","Atlanta, Ga.",47800000,19.5,14,40,4800000,2014,"No"
"Eddie Merlot’s","This concept, developed by early Subway franchisee and wine aficionado Bill Humphries, sets itself apart from other steakhouses by actively marketing to women; females account for 45 percent of its customers. It courts them by opening up the space with light woods and vibrant colors, setting the table with fine china and offering a value-priced wine list with a by-the-glass selection. The female-friendly menu goes beyond the usual steak and seafood with entrees such as Pecan Crusted Trout and Beef Short Rib Stroganoff. ","Fort Wayne, Ind.",4.3e+07,19.4,9,12.5,4800000,2014,"No"
"Wings Etc. Grill & Pub","Jumbo Buffalo wings are the signature here, but the Etc. part describes baby back ribs, nachos, fried pickle spears, even salads. Wings Etc. bills itself as a family-oriented sports bar and provides a video arcade where the kids can hang out while their parents drink beer and watch a game. The focus on activity continues with a “Wall of Flame” that honors customers who have eaten 16 jumbo wings coated with the chain’s spiciest sauce.","Fort Wayne, Ind.",27200000,17.4,26,18.2,1100000,2014,"Yes"
"Gigi’s Cupcakes","Gigi’s is infused with the personality of Gigi herself, the founder of the concept and a musician-turned-cupcake baker. Her rags-to-riches story is relayed on the website, along with the personal yarns of new franchisees who join the “family.” That spirit of connection, and the fact that 10 daily-changing cupcakes are baked fresh in each store sets Gigi’s apart in the narrow dessert niche.","Franklin, Tenn.",3.5e+07,17.2,95,20.3,4e+05,2014,"Yes"
"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","Craft-beer pioneers Chris Cramer and Matt Rattner opened their first brewpub in 1989. The beer was such a hit that they eventually built a brewery, won a slew of awards for the beers and opened more brewpubs, all in Southern California. Karl Strauss has built a fan following by continuously introducing innovative brews and encouraging guest interaction. In celebration of its 25th anniversary, the company opened a new tasting room and beer garden in San Diego and is launching several barrel-aged beers.","San Diego, Calif.",26900000,17,8,14.3,3600000,2014,"No"
"Zoup! Fresh Soup Company","More than 200 proprietary soups are served at Zoup! on a rotating basis, with a dozen selections daily. The recipes were fine-tuned by the founders, former owners of a spice and soup-mix company. To appeal to every dietary need, these cover the gamut of lowfat, vegetarian, dairy-free and gluten-free varieties. Customers not in a soup mood can opt for SandwichZ and GreenZ (salads), added to diversify the menu two years after the 1997 launch. When franchising began in 2007, Zoup! expanded beyond its Michigan roots.","Southfield, Mich.",39600000,16.5,55,19.6,785000,2014,"Yes"
"Lee’s Sandwiches","Lee’s evolved from a catering truck in the early ’80s to a chain of brick-and-mortar stores built around a menu of traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. Its several prototypes are adaptable to locations in shopping malls, near office buildings or adjacent to college campuses. The customer base is broad, but younger crowds dominate. Brightly lit menu boards display the lineup in several languages, a nod to the large number of Asian and Hispanic patrons. ","San Jose, Calif.",26200000,16.4,53,15.2,530000,2014,"Yes"
"Tokyo Joe’s","A menu of grilled and steamed dishes, a focus on organic ingredients and Tokyo Joe’s sleek decor are magnets for the customer seeking a more stylish experience at fast-casual prices. The chain started in 1996 when Japanese food was less familiar, but the Americanized name, high-energy ambience and accessible menu attracted mainstream customers. As the concept has evolved, the menu has broadened to include more Pan-Asian dishes while still maintaining a healthy halo.","Centennial, Colo.",25600000,16.4,26,13,1e+06,2014,"Yes"
"Pancheros Mexican Grill","Known for its housemade tortillas, custom burrito-mixing tool and restaurants free of microwaves and freezers, Pancheros spent part of 2013 revamping its menu system. While its Mexican fare remains the same, the simplified menu guides guests through the ordering process with boards to designate entrees, proteins, add-ons, sides and beverages. The chain also continues to build its menu, adding two proprietary hot sauces at all restaurants in March.","Coralville, Iowa",48800000,16.2,65,32.7,855000,2014,"Yes"
"Pluckers Wing Bar","Named one of the nation’s Top 10 Wing Restaurants by USA Today in 2012, Plucker’s has established a near cultlike following for its wings and more than 15 signature sauces. But it’s popular for more than just the food. ESPN named it one of the Top 5 Sports Bars in North America that same year, with each location paying homage to the local neighborhood. To keep actively engaged with its audience, Pluckers runs Facebook contests and giveaways regularly.","Austin, Texas",30200000,16.2,16,14.3,2e+06,2014,"Yes"
"Taco Casa","Taco Casa spent much of 2013 adding new units, bringing its count to more than 60 sites—all in Texas. The chain plans to continue on this growth path, with several others opened in 2014 and even more planned for later this year. Catering to the trend towards freshness, the chain touts its food as “real fresh, real food, real good,” all served at an affordable price point. ","Fort Worth, Texas",31300000,15.9,16,21.2,545000,2014,"Yes"
"Stanford’s Restaurant & Bar","This casual neighborhood concept scores big with young professional looking for a quick lunch as well as with families out for a leisurely dinner.

"Alonti Catering Cafe","Alonti targets locations near urban office and medical buildings, to capture professionals with breakfast, sandwiches, salads and more. It also heavily emphasizes catering, amping up the focus on large orders in recent years. To do this, it woos secretaries, often tasked with placing orders, by touting easy online ordering and in-house “catering coaches.” ","Houston, Texas",35900000,14,42,31.3,970000,2014,"No"
"Grimaldi’s Coal Brick-Oven Pizzeria","True to its name, Grimaldi’s cooks its pizzas and calzones in hand-built, coal-fired brick ovens that are visible to the guests, resulting in a crisp crust.

"Roberto’s Taco Shop","Named to The Best of Las Vegas list by the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2013, 50-year-old Roberto’s has established itself as a leading Mexican chain in southern Nevada and in and around its hometown of San Diego.

"WaBa Grill","WaBa Grill touts its devotion to healthy cuisine by making diners aware of its use of skinless, fat-trimmed chicken, lightly steamed veggies and other additive-free ingredients. The rice bowls and teriyaki plates are cooked fresh to order using no oil, resulting in a low-fat entree that’s still ready in what WaBa calls “on the go” speed. The chain also has announced ambitious expansion goals.","City of Industry, Calif.",45800000,13.6,53,20.5,945000,2014,"Yes"
"Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant","Developed by two home brewers, this chain of brewpubs stands out for its craft beers and a chef-driven, fresh-from-scratch menu to go along with them. Individual locations pump up the local crowd with beer release parties for site-specific brews, as well as with beer-inspired dinners and brunches. Iron Hill caters specifically to its East Coast community by running its own charitable foundation and fundraising programs.","Wilmington, Del.",26700000,13.6,10,11.1,2800000,2014,"No"
"East Coast Wings & Grill","In an effort to appeal to families, East Coast Wings differentiates itself from other wing concepts by de-emphasizing alcohol, devoting a majority of the menu and advertising materials to food, as well as telling potential franchisees that “bar service exists only to complement the food.” While most locations are full service, East Coast recently rolled out a limited-service prototype, offering takeout in a smaller footprint. For all stores, the wing chain released a mobile app this past March to ease the takeout process. Now guests can place their orders from their smartphones and bypass the line entirely. ","Winston-Salem, N.C.",32600000,12.4,27,17.4,1300000,2014,"Yes"
"Roosters","There are burgers, subs and  pizza—and, of course, there are the signature jumbo chicken wings. The varied menu and come-as-you-are attitude appeals to families and adults-only groups alike. But Roosters doesn’t limit itself to traditional; it serves at local Ohio sporting events from its Roosters Roadshow truck and has concessions at Ohio State University’s basketball stadium. To cut costs and preserve profits, most storefronts are developed from defunct restaurants instead of being built new, and members of the management team work from their homes.","Dublin, Ohio",41300000,11.6,31,10.7,1400000,2014,"Yes"
"Crumbs Bake Shop","This shop helped launch the cupcake craze in the U.S. with its more than 50 varieties of fresh-baked, gourmet cupcakes. While it fared well in this ranking based on 2013 sales, Crumbs is not off to a bright start in 2014. A filing with the SEC in May noted that auditors have doubts about its ability to continue growing. In fact, it’s gone down in size, reporting 58 locations in the filing, a dip from 65 in March of this year.","New York City, N.Y.",4.8e+07,11.6,78,32.2,701000,2014,"No"
"Pieology Pizzeria","Walk into any Pieology, and in place of wallpaper or posters, you’ll be greeted by a giant “quote board” filled with inspiring sayings. Many of the more than 500 phrases encouraging happiness, smiling and respect for others were chosen by the wife of Pieology’s CEO Carl Chang to exemplify what guests will experience at the “better pizza” chain.","Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.",44600000,230.4,42,180,1600000,2015,"Yes"
"Blaze Pizza","In the fast-growing, build-your-own pizza category, three-year-old Blaze claims to be the most ambitious, adding delivery and boasting that it has the most locations open, the most in the pipeline, low opening and operating costs and AUVs higher than pre-IPO Chipotle. Right up there with its made-from-scratch dough and “clean ingredients” messaging is its 180-seconds service promise. It foresees 2,000 units in the U.S. with some high-profile backers, including Lebron James, Maria Shriver and basketball-star-turned-Power-20-franchisee Junior Bridgeman. ","Pasadena, Calif.",3.3e+07,230,50,400,1500000,2015,"Yes"
"Smallcakes A Cupcakery","Apparently this ambitious bakery chain, with sights on international growth, didn’t get the memo that cupcakes are out. Appearances on the Food Network, a new cookbook and a gig catering the MTV Video Music Awards has helped keep it in the spotlight. To sweeten the franchising pot, Smallcakes began co-branding units in September 2014 with its new Smallcakes Creamery concept that serves small-batch ice cream made daily; 15 such co-branded units are on tap for 2015. ","Overland Park, Kan.",38700000,133.1,88,114.6,6e+05,2015,"Yes"
" Nékter Juice Bar","Steve and Alexis Schulze, the husband and wife team behind Nékter, are aiming to “save the world” from sugary juice and coffee. Their menu, which started with cold-pressed juices and smoothies made with fruits and veggies has grown in the five years since Nékter was founded to include acai bowls, salads and snacks. Online ordering, an in-app rewards program and a line of bottled cleanse drinks are designed to make its products a part of its hardcore, health-minded customers’ daily lives.","Santa Ana, Calif.",26800000,119.7,46,100,775000,2015,"Yes"
"MOD Pizza","The third DIY pizza concept in the Top 5 currently is the smallest, but quickly is catching up with an explosive growth plan. Founded in 2008 by the owners of Seattle Coffee Company, Mod was the first of the bunch to offer customized pies baked in 800-degree ovens in less than three minutes. Though it only opened its first unit outside of Washington in 2013, it has plans—and $70 million in financing—to open 100 more by the end of the year. The founders count several Starbucks alum among their executive “MOD Squad” and advisory board.","Bellevue, Wash.",2.7e+07,107.7,31,121.4,1200000,2015,"Yes"
"Salata","Billing itself as “the next-generation salad bar,” Salata, which means salad in Latin, is hoping for longevity in a category that has seen similar concepts wither and die. Founder Berge Simonian is doing his homework to avoid a similar fate—calling his Chicago-area debut last fall “an experiment” to see how Salata “could do in a northern environment,” as he told Crain’s Chicago Business. It’s typical behavior for Simonian, who spent a year researching the formulas for Salata’s 10 proprietary dressings, all sold bottled in-store.",NA,33300000,89.2,41,51.9,812000,2015,"Yes"
" Rock & Brews","Though best known as the concept co-founded by Kiss frontmen Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, this rock-and-roll-theme casual-dining chain goes out of its way to convey a family-friendly (and dog-friendly) concert environment. Patios and kids’ play areas invite guests to hang out. As expected, rock memorabilia defines the decor and a retail section sells branded merchandise. Looking to extend its “world tour” through franchising, the three-year-old brand named a restaurant-development veteran as its first CEO in November.","El Segundo, Calif.",32100000,52.9,7,40,5300000,2015,"Yes"
"Nando’s Peri-Peri","The chicken chain with South African roots first landed in the U.S. in 2008 and has since grown its footprint, with Chicago being its most recent new market. In the last year, the chain more than doubled its sales, besting its fast-casual chicken competition that saw sales grow anywhere from 20 percent (Raising Cane’s) to less than one percent (Boston Market). Unlike others in the category, its chicken has an authentic, ethnic flair with a spicy kick, thanks to the Portuguese peri-peri sauce made from bird’s-eye chilies.","Washington, D.C.",32600000,52.5,20,33.3,1900000,2015,"No"
"Paul Martin’s American Grill","Think Cheesecake Factory meets Seasons 52. Locations of this casual chain from Paul Fleming (middle name: Martin), co-founder of P.F. Chang’s and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar, are housed in large, freestanding stores, often in malls. They boast “accessible prices” (average check is $30.60), quality ingredients and a large wine collection on display. The brand has trademarked “Seasonal and Delicious” as its tagline and sports artisanal,  housemade and natural as menu buzzwords.","Newport Beach, Calif.",34500000,45.9,8,33.3,5e+06,2015,"Yes"
"Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern","In the competitive, casual burger market, Bagger Dave’s makes the ordering process interactive. Patrons are given a paper to mark off their choices from a list of proteins, buns, cheeses, sauces, premium toppings and “meaningless toppings” (from ketchup to black-bean chili) to build their own burger. The make-your-own theme extends to the beer list where guests can select four brews for a craft-beer flight. Adult shakes and bourbons are other boozy options. To add entertainment, electric trains run through each restaurant.","Southfield, Mich.",2.7e+07,44.9,24,26.3,1300000,2015,"No"
"Lemonade","Its name is deceiving—Lemonade is much more than a place for consumers to quench their thirst. It’s a hip cafeteria with an international menu and designer dishware that reflect Los Angeles’s diverse neighborhoods. Billing itself as a healthy fast casual, Lemonade’s “seasonal Southern California comfort food” menu offers more than the usual kale salads and wraps. It has braises, chili, sandwiches, salads and, of course, seven lemonade choices to wash it all down. Average check is $11.50. The chain’s growth currently is limited to California.",NA,3.6e+07,40.6,16,23.1,2500000,2015,"No"
"Bareburger","Clean labels are the name of the game for this Queens-born chain. Its customizable burgers (including elk, bison, vegetarian options and more), sandwiches and salads boast organic, antibiotic- and GMO-free ingredients. Mostly located in neighborhoods, interiors are made with reclaimed materials. Bareburger avoids a preachy tone, however, describing its “Chief Bear,” CEO Euripides Pelekano, as enjoying “happy people, success stories and long walks on the beach.” Bareburger is expected to launch Burnside, a fried-chicken-and-biscuit concept in Queens this month.","Astoria, N.Y.",46500000,39.2,21,23.5,2500000,2015,"Yes"
"The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co.","The in-store water-purification system is a focus at each location. Housed in a glass-enclosed room, it claims to process water (for cooking and bottled for sale) that replicates the water that flows “through the Catskill Mountains … into the homes of Brooklyn residents.” A new prototype takes the message outside with a water tower atop the store. It also marks the debut of dinner, a line of healthier dishes and a “coffee wall” with self-serve taps.","Delray Beach, Fla.",42100000,38,25,31.6,1900000,2015,"Yes"
"Torchy’s Tacos","A fast casual with roots as a trailer dragged by a Vespa scooter, this contemporary chain asserts that it’s serving “damn good tacos”—both traditional and breakfast tacos—along with “award-winning” salsa and margaritas, in select locations. While it’s solely in Texas, Torchy’s announced that it plans to open its first out-of-state spot in Denver this fall. It’s appeal? It’s hitting on trends: using responsibly sourced ingredients that are regional when possible and eco-friendly packaging, especially for to-go meals.","Austin, Texas",2.5e+07,37.4,26,23.8,1100000,2015,"No"
"Billy Sims Barbecue","Former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL Rookie of the Year Billy Sims, along with partner Jeff Jackson, got into the regional barbecue game to sling Oklahoma-style ’cue. Ten years later, the football-themed quick-service concept has expanded into six states, including two nontraditional units in sports stadiums that opened in 2014. Focused on serving authentic cuisine—a selling point among millennial diners today—it claims to be among the top-rated athlete-owned restaurants.","Tulsa, Okla.",3.1e+07,37.2,44,18.9,765000,2015,"Yes"
" Native Foods Café","The vegan fast casual set its sights on growth in the last year, almost doubling in size and expanding into new markets. And it plans to continue at a fast clip: included in the announcement of a new CEO in February, Native Foods said it plans to have 200 stores within four years. But it’s not just focused on growing the unit count. The chef-driven concept expanded catering to all sites at the beginning of the year and launched a cookbook to get its name out in new markets.",NA,4.5e+07,35.5,25,47.1,2100000,2015,"No"
" Taziki’s Mediterranean Cafe","When founder Keith Richards took a family trip to Greece, he brought back the idea for the now-burgeoning chain that boasts the healthfulness of the Mediterranean diet. To promote its better-for-you message, Taziki’s takes to social media with transparent posts such as “We have over 100 items made fresh daily!” and “No freezers, fryers, or microwaves.” It’s also building its following through nontraditional marketing by participating in local festivals, events and dine-arounds in its different markets, largely focused in the South.","Birmingham, Ala.",48600000,34.6,36,16.1,1500000,2015,"Yes"
" Eureka!","Eureka! is all about local—local produce, local beers and even local music. Self-described as “the enlightening burger experience,” the casual-dining spot offers all-American options such as chicken wings, flat-iron steak and corn-dog lollipops, with a focus on handmade dishes. Entertainment also is a focus, with a house-curated playlist, televised sports and live music. While growth is concentrated in the San Francisco Bay area, the chain also has moved into Texas and Washington.","Hawthorne, Calif.",30600000,34.2,14,27.3,2500000,2015,"No"
"Veggie Grill","Veggie Grill uses only plant-based ingredients on its menu, but the global flavors, seasonal ingredients and chef-inspired dishes draw meat eaters as well as vegetarians. The company’s goal is to double sales every 18 to 24 months and make it a top choice among health-conscious diners. In the last five years, its compound annual growth rate was 43.1 percent.","Santa Monica, Calif.",35400000,33.1,26,18.2,1500000,2015,"No"
"Freshii","The health-focused fast casual is in the middle of a growth spurt; it announced in late November that it plans to open 160 franchised units in 2015. But it’s not just resting on expansion to build business. The chain continues to update its menu to stay on top of trends, adding a line of nutrient-dense juices in January and starting a test of frozen kefir at select units in late March, all in line with its goal of serving energizing meals and snacks to on-the-go diners.",NA,41800000,32.3,52,23.8,890000,2015,"Yes"
"Sandella’s Flatbread Café","Originally started in 1994 as an upscale coffee and sandwich shop, the fast-casual bakery-cafe is competing in the better-sandwich market, which is on an upswing right now. Appealing to the health-conscious crowd, the chain is transparent with its menu of wraps, panini, quesadillas and salads, even listing the exact four ingredients in its signature brick-oven flatbread on its website. ","West Redding, Conn.",32300000,31.8,107,17.6,301000,2015,"Yes"
"Barcelona Wine Bar & Restaurant","The chef at each upscale-casual unit creates about a third of the menu. But it’s not just the Spanish tapas that differ. Each location has a unique design to give it a more independent vibe. To add to sales, as well as reach beyond its East Coast home-base, Barcelona added an online store in December for olive oil, paella kits and more.","South Norwalk, Conn.",43800000,29.6,10,11.1,4600000,2015,"No"
"Rusty Bucket Restaurant and Tavern","A sister company of multiconcept operator Cameron Mitchell Restaurants, this tavern-style chain has expansion on its mind. “While we have grown steadily since our founding in 2002, the upcoming year represents our most aggressive growth strategy to date,” said president and founder Gary Callicoat in a release in February. Instead of large cities, it has pegged smaller markets in Ohio and Michigan for its growth. ","Columbus, Ohio",43600000,29.4,17,13.3,2800000,2015,"No"
"Yogen Früz","While the frozen-yogurt boom may be on the same market-saturation path as cupcakes, this international chain’s positioning as a nutritious alternative to traditional frozen sweets has helped it continue to grow. To set itself apart, it promotes probiotic-packed treats. And it also touts “profitable and responsible growth” as one of the business’s key values. With real estate a growing problem in the industry, its small footprint and limited seating make mall spots and other nontraditional locations realistic ventures.","Scottsdale, Ariz.",27400000,28.6,117,30,265000,2015,"Yes"
"Paris Baguette","The bakery-cafe chain first entered the U.S. market by way of Los Angeles in 2005 and has spent the past decade growing in California and on the East Coast. Its Facebook page reads like a map pinpointing its development in urban areas. What sets Paris Baguette apart is its glass display cases filled with a range of pastries and desserts and its array of salads and sandwiches in grab-and-go boxes for diners who don’t have time to wait for an order to be prepared.","Moonachie, N.J.",29400000,27.3,38,18.8,840000,2015,"Yes"
"Bob’s Steak & Chop House","Even with a sordid past of bankruptcy and scandal, this high-end steakhouse chain has managed to grow. A Dallas institution, it is withstanding the shift towards more casual restaurants and still enforcing its business-casual dress code in an upscale environment. The brand not only continues to grow in size, but it’s winning over fans. At one of its newer locations in the Omni Nashville Hotel (Omni owns a 50 percent stake in the chain), it was named a 2015 Diners’ Choice Winner by OpenTable.","Plano, Texas",38400000,25.5,11,10,3700000,2015,"Yes"
"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","The interactive Mongolian-born chain where diners cook their food tableside in steaming pots of broth is being blamed, at least partially, for majority stakeholder Yum Brand’s loss in 2014, announced in February. The chain, purchased by the fast-food powerhouse in 2012 as part of its expansion to China, is said to have shrinking value in its homeland. Yet Yum, while admittedly disappointed with  Little Sheep’s performance abroad, still is expanding the chain stateside via franchisees. ","City of Industry, Calif.",35400000,22.1,16,33.3,2500000,2015,"Yes"
"Wings Etc. Grill & Pub","As its name suggests, the family-friendly sports bar takes pride in its jumbo Buffalo wings, available with 18 sauces. Its “Wall of Flame” hot-wings challenge is a signature, recognizing customers who have eaten 16 wings tossed in its spiciest sauce. But it’s not just about the wings. The chain serves up traditional American fare, including ribs, burgers, wraps and fried shrimp. To draw customers in the door, Wings Etc. offers daily food and drink specials, a lunch menu and an interactive video arcade to entertain kids.","Fort Wayne, Ind.",32900000,21,32,23.1,1100000,2015,"Yes"
"Toppers Pizza","Located near college towns, the quick-service pizza chain targets younger consumers, especially millennials, in its marketing, reliance on social media and eclectic menu items such as mac-and-cheese pizza. To compete with national brands such as Pizza Hut and Domino’s that have made big investments in tech, Toppers plans to roll out a new ordering system this year—especially as online ordering becomes increasingly popular among its consumers. While the chain doesn’t have an app yet, it’s in the works. But the first goal is to create a site that’s responsive to various mobile devices.","Whitewater, Wis.",48800000,20.3,67,31.4,829000,2015,"Yes"
"North Italia","The contemporary Italian chain from multiconcept operator Fox Restaurant Concepts prides itself on handmade pasta and pizza, the cornerstone of its menu. The second-largest chain in the FRC portfolio crafts a large portion of its menu daily, then serves it up in a sleek setting, typically in high-traffic areas. While Arizona is North Italia’s home state—and where the majority of its units are located—it’s now growing in other areas of the West, including its second Texas spot that opened in February and its first California location, set to open this summer.",NA,30500000,20.1,7,16.7,4700000,2015,"No"
"Marlow’s Tavern","This suburban chain is known for putting a cheffy twist on American classics on a seasonally inspired menu that includes center-cut filet and crispy snapper. Still, it bills itself as a modern, casual tavern. Its partners—with more than 130 collective years of chain experience with operations such as Darden, Boston Market and TGI Fridays—are keying into long-standing dining trends, working open kitchens, communal tables and outdoor seating into the design.","Atlanta, Ga.",48500000,18.3,15,15.4,3500000,2015,"No"
"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que","In November, the barbecue chain with a biker-bar-meets-honky-tonk atmosphere formed a back-office partnership with Alabama-based Jim ’N Nick’s Community Bar-B-Q. It’s a deal the chains say won’t change either brand but will help strengthen purchasing power and lower labor and other employee-related costs. With that newfound strength, Dinosaur has its eye on expansion into new markets; it opened its first Chicago spot a few months ago and plans to launch its 10th restaurant this summer in Baltimore. For site selection, the chain targets buildings with history that also can serve as stages for live music on the weekends. Lunch delivery began in February.","Syracuse, N.Y.",27200000,18.3,8,14.3,3600000,2015,"No"
"Tokyo Joe’s","No deep frying, no MSG, no greasy wok cooking; Tokyo Joe’s built its brand around grilled and steamed Japanese dishes made with natural proteins, wild seafood and organic product, when possible. The goal: Deliver fresh and balanced foods at fast-casual speed and prices. As more Asian-inspired concepts enter the segment, Tokyo Joe’s has managed to maintain its hold by broadening its menu to include more pan-Asian dishes. While the majority of its units are in Colorado, it pushed into Arizona last year with plans to enter Texas later this spring. ","Centennial, Colo.",30100000,17.6,30,15.4,1100000,2015,"Yes"
"Taco Casa","Boasting that it’s “still the same since 1972,” the quick-service chain maintains its positioning of freshness, serving classic Mexican dishes such as tacos and burritos, typically for under $3. Taco Casa spent much of the last year growing its brand to nearly 80 units to date, all in Texas. And growth doesn’t look to be slowing; it’s got three more sites set to open in The Lone Star State in the near future.","Fort Worth, Texas",36600000,16.9,70,11.1,550000,2015,"Yes"
"Zoup! Fresh Soup Company","As its name suggests, Zoup! offers a rotating roster of 200 proprietary soups. But to keep up in the competitive fast-casual segment, the menu has expanded to include salads and sandwiches. Ahead of the broth trend the chain in 2013 started selling veggie and chicken broth at retail for consumers to use in their own recipes. Zoup! launched in 1998 and has gradually expanded beyond its Michigan roots, most recently opening a store in Columbus, Ohio in March.","Southfield, Mich.",46300000,16.9,63,14.5,785000,2015,"Yes"
"Barberitos","This build-your-own fast casual’s growth has been concentrated in the Southeast (close to its home-base) with a menu that skews to the Southwest. Barberitos is competing in the same space as larger players such as Qdoba, Chipotle and Moe’s Southwest Grill, offering scratch-made items such as burritos, quesadillas, fajitas and bowls. Featured proteins include chicken, grass-fed beef, ground turkey and organic tofu.","Athens, Ga.",27900000,16.7,39,11.4,755000,2015,"Yes"
"East Coast Wings & Grill","Launched as a casual-dining concept along the lines of Buffalo Wild Wings, East Coast Wings & Grill more recently introduced a smaller prototype designed for the limited-service segment. Wings are the focus, but the menu also includes entree salads, sandwiches and chili. While some locations have bars, the chain positions itself as a family-friendly destination. The brand has experienced 11 consecutive years of positive same-store sales growth through 2014.","Winston-Salem, N.C.",3.8e+07,16.6,32,18.5,1500000,2015,"Yes"
"Ono Hawaiian BBQ","Hawaiian concepts are rare on the mainland, which makes Ono stand out in the fast-casual crowd. The menu features a fusion of Asian cuisines with some American touches. Customers gravitate toward the popular $10 plate lunch, a Hawaiian specialty that features barbecued chicken, beef or seafood with rice and macaroni salad over steamed cabbage. Other island dishes also are offered as both family meals and single entrees. So far, Ono’s locations have been limited to California and Arizona.","Diamond Bar, Calif.",30800000,16.2,53,20.5,635000,2015,"No"
"American Deli","Despite its name, the eclectic menu here includes much more than just sandwiches. Buffalo wings, fried rice, gyros and burgers also are on offer. Most of the locations are near shopping malls and office complexes built as both freestanding and inline units, but the quick-service chain also operates smaller-footprint kiosks in food courts. The first restaurant opened in 1989; American Deli has been growing slowly but steadily throughout the Southeast and Texas for 25 years.","Riverdale, Ga.",48800000,15.4,96,15.7,545000,2015,"Yes"
"The Rock Wood Fired Kitchen","The focal point at this rock-and-roll-inspired restaurant is a giant brick exhibition oven designated for cooking signature wood-fired pizzas that anchor its menu. In some locales, the casual-dining concept is called Rock Wood Fired Pizza & Spirits, though all locations serve alcohol in addition to the pub-style fare. Most units are located in the Northwest and Colorado, and The Rock has plans to develop 20 more stores by 2020, according to its website.","Sumner, Wash.",4.7e+07,15.2,21,23.5,2500000,2015,"Yes"
"Jimmy’s Egg","Breakfast tacos, along with the expected breakfast-lunch fare—French toast, create-your-own omelets, burgers, sandwiches and salads—make up the menu at this emerging chain. Jimmy’s Egg competes in the family-dining space with players such as IHOP, Denny’s and Waffle House, but is exceeding those more established chains in sales growth as it concentrates its expansion in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and the surrounding states. A recent promotion featured lighter items.","Edmond, Okla.",27900000,14.6,40,11.1,741000,2015,"Yes"
"Showmars","Made-to-order burgers on pita breads are the specialty here.

"Russo’s New York Pizzeria","Russo’s builds out two prototypes—full-size units in suburban malls and smaller express units in food courts and nontraditional spaces. This year the chain announced it would be expanding to Europe. In 2008, Russo’s created a sister concept called Russo’s Coal-Fired Italian Kitchen, which also is part of the company’s franchising portfolio.

" Bono’s Pit Bar-B-Q","This midscale chain offers Southern-style barbecue finished in a live pit. The smoked meats are served family-style on platters. All the restaurants are freestanding, designed to resemble barbecue shacks, with interiors that boast a down-home country look and feel. Branded sauces and merchandise are sold online. Bono’s also operates a fast-casual spinoff, Willie Jewell’s Old School Bar-B-Q.","Jacksonville, Fla.",30300000,11.8,22,15.8,1500000,2015,"Yes"
"Hale and Hearty Soups","When Hale and Hearty began in 1995, only soups were on the menu—all made from scratch daily in a more than a dozen varieties. Sandwiches and salads were added in 1998, and now the concept positions itself squarely in the healthy fast-casual space. Soup-and-sandwich combos are best-sellers during the high-traffic lunch daypart. Units reside mostly in busy urban areas with expansion limited to New York state until earlier this year, when a store opened in Boston.",NA,27700000,11.7,33,13.8,895000,2015,"No"
"Native Grill & Wings","In 2014, Native New Yorker officially changed its name to Native Grill & Wings to reinforce the chain’s signature: its 19 flavors of chicken wings. However, the sports grill offers more than wings; flatbreads, sandwiches, salads and fish platters also are available on the extensive menu. The chain recently has expanded from its Arizona roots to Colorado and Texas and has launched a special-events food truck.","Gilbert, Ariz.",43700000,11.5,31,19.2,1500000,2015,"Yes"
"Leo’s Coney Island","Focusing its growth in Michigan, this family-style chain is about evenly divided between company-owned and franchised units. The restaurants are on the small side, seating between 50 and 100 guests for breakfast, lunch and dinner, where they can order its namesake Coney Island-style hot dogs, along with everything from Greek moussaka to stir-fries.","Birmingham, Mich.",30400000,11.4,54,22.7,620000,2015,"Yes"
"Another Broken Egg Cafe","This breakfast-lunch chain leans on its cozy French country ambiance, foodie-friendly breakfast and brunch dishes and $13.50 average check to set it apart. The menu balances indulgent items with healthier ones and offers cocktails, including a bloody Mary and mimosa. While many units are in high-end resorts and sports communities in the Southeast, the chain plans to debut its 50th restaurant this year with expansion into Memphis, Tenn. and the launch of its first university location.","Destin, Fla.",42900000,11,41,51.9,1300000,2015,"Yes"

That’s the premise behind this 12-year-old chain, which focuses on warm cake doughnuts topped with a choice of icings and toppings such as peanuts, marshmallow and salted caramel. Stores feature a viewing area, so guests can watch the doughnut-making process. The chain is currently testing online ordering, with plans to roll the program out nationwide by the end of the year. ","Mechanicsburg, Pa.",2.4e+07,72.9,58,48.7,5e+05,2018,"Yes"
"1000 Degrees Neapolitan Pizza","With several customizable pizza concepts that cook pies in minutes, this growing brand focuses on Neapolitan-style pies made with quality ingredients. 1000 Degrees sets itself apart with its 100-year old dough recipe from Naples that’s made with a fork-style mixer—not a dough hook—and is hand-stretched. The chain offers more than 40 sauces, cheeses and other toppings, along with wings and salads. The chain also recently added a self-serve beer and wine option for its franchisees.","Galloway, N.Y.",2.6e+07,66.7,34,70,980000,2018,"Yes"
"Dog Haus","Since signing a large franchise-development deal in 2016, this fast-casual hot dog concept has been growth-minded, expanding into new markets. Since opening its first unit in 2010, the chain has become known for its all-beef hot dogs, burgers, sausages and other sandwiches, all served on soft Hawaiian rolls. Units also serve craft beer. To cater to consumers’ growing interest in clean ingredients, the company last year shifted to vegetarian-fed meats that have been raised without antibiotics or hormones. ","Pasadena, Calif.",2.4e+07,58.2,31,55,950000,2018,"Yes"
"Your Pie","Your Pie first opened in 2008, making it relatively old in the fast-casual pizza sector. The chain has been overshadowed by a number of larger players in more recent years, but that could change based on its recent growth in sales and unit count. The chain boasts pizzas such as the Southern Heat, with Buffalo sauce, mozzarella, chicken, red onions and jalapeno. And unlike some of its competitors, its menu goes beyond pizza with panini and gelato, along with chopped salads and a selection of beer and wine. ","Athens, Ga.",2.7e+07,58,47,38.2,680000,2018,"Yes"
"Naf Naf Grill","Naf Naf Grill is making a push to bring shawarma to the masses. As part of that, the chain—which is owned by private-equity firm Roark Capital—brought over Paul Damico, former Focus Brands president, as CEO. “The concept is ready to be franchised,” he told Restaurant Business in January. This year, it also launched a digital app, in part to capitalize on the off-premise boom. In addition to online sales from that app and its website, Naf Naf is focusing on catering as a sales driver. ","Naperville, Ill.",4.8e+07,58,38,52,1500000,2018,"Yes"
"Kura Revolving Sushi Bar","In the U.S., Kura is a rapidly growing chain that serves sushi and Japanese side dishes. In Japan, however, the chain is widespread, with more than 385 locations throughout the island. Kura brings high-tech elements to the rotating sushi bar concept: Customers place an order on a touch panel, and food is delivered on a conveyor belt. Sushi arrives within a minute, and a side item in about four minutes. There’s a slot on the side of the table for empty plates.","Irvine, Calif.",3.7e+07,57.8,14,27.3,3200000,2018,"No"
"R Taco","R Taco was acquired last year as part of Arby’s purchase of Buffalo Wild Wings. But the chain was hardly a throw-in. Despite activist pressure, BWW held onto the fast-casual taco chain, even as it sold its pizza concept, PizzaRev. Now, R Taco gives its parent, the newly created Inspire Brands, a growth concept. The chain, formerly known as Rusty Taco, offers a wide selection of tacos, including versions with fried chicken, achiote pork, fried fish, beef brisket and grilled vegetables, as well as all-day breakfast tacos. ",NA,2.4e+07,55.4,26,77.3,1200000,2018,"Yes"
"The Simple Greek","The Simple Greek is known for its relationship with Marcus Lemonis, host of CNBC series “The Profit.” On the show, Lemonis turns around a struggling business and buys a stake in it, something he did for The Simple Greek, then known as My Big Fat Greek Gyro. It was converted into a  fast casual, serving customizable bowls and pitas, hummus, lentil soup and desserts. Since then, the chain has been in growth mode, opening 17 units in 2017, with 30 more planned for this year. ",NA,2.1e+07,55.1,15,36.4,1600000,2018,"No"
"Famous Toastery","The 25-unit chain was founded in 2005 in a small house that Brian Burchill and Robert Maynard converted into a restaurant. It quickly grew to three locations, serving dishes such as avocado Benedict and housemade hash. The company started franchising in 2013 and has become mostly franchise-run. While it is still focused on dine-in traffic, the chain has had to adjust to the growing demand for grab-and-go options, adding more warmers and reach-in coolers.","Charlotte, N.C.",3e+07,53.7,25,47.1,1500000,2018,"Yes"
"The Lost Cajun","The wandering Louisianan in question is Raymond “Griff” Griffin, a onetime fish lodge operator who left the land of gumbo and later found himself in the unlikely outpost of Frisco, Colo. He and his late wife opened a restaurant featuring just four Mississippi Delta specialties, including beignets. The authentic fare was a hit, leading to an expanded menu and outlets as far afield as Greenville, S.C. The emphasis is still on gumbos and platters of fried fish, with a few nods (such as pasta) to Yankee tastes.","Covington, La.",2.5e+07,53.6,12,33.3,2500000,2018,"Yes"
"HopCat","HopCat is proof that casual dining still has plenty of potential, though don’t suggest it’s in the same class as the big casual-dining brands. The concept takes pride in being an anti-chain chain, with designs specific to each location. Ditto for the 100-plus selection of beers in each store, curated by that location’s full-time beer program manager. Attitude abounds, as evidenced by the name given to its signature fries selections: Crack Fries (spiced with cracked black pepper), Vladimir Poutine and Sloppy Crack Fries (topped with sloppy Joe). ","Grand Rapids, Mich.",4.8e+07,48.9,16,23.1,3400000,2018,"No"
"Bombshells","Bombshells may be the least decadent of the establishments run by RCI Hospitality Holdings, whose main business is running gentlemen’s clubs. But it’s not the loose war theme or menu of sports bar staples that have made the concept a hit. Bombshells is unabashedly a breastaurant, though the attractions also extend to live music and more grilled items than might be served by the scantily clad waitresses of competing chains. It intends to have 10 units open by the middle of next year. ",NA,2.2e+07,46.7,6,50,4400000,2018,"Yes"
"&pizza","Fast casual’s proud iconoclast continues to challenge sector conventions with adjustments to each unit’s setting. A branch serving Washington, D.C.’s hip new “micro-hotel,” Hotel Hive, for instance, features a breakfast menu of sweet and savory a.m. pizzas, cold-pressed juices, yogurt and fruit. The chain received an infusion of growth capital last year from RSE Ventures, which &pizza has invested in talent development and opening units in New York, Miami and Boston, according to a spokesperson.","Washington, D.C.",2.9e+07,42.8,26,36.8,1300000,2018,"No"
"Teriyaki Madness","Teriyaki Madness describes its menu as “Seattle teriyaki,” a reference to the Asian-bowl joints that dot the progressive Pacific Northwest city. The fast-casual concept has grown from its first location in 2003 to about 50 stores nationwide, but it talks a much bigger story. It has signed deals for 140 new franchise stores and also expects to have 100 units open within a decade in Mexico, where its first international outpost is slated to open later this year. ",NA,2.9e+07,42,42,20,760000,2018,"Yes"
"LA Crawfish","The signatures of New Orleans and Vietnam come together in this Texas limited-service concept. LA Crawfish adds the twist of an extensive pho array, an apparent tribute to its home state’s sizable Vietnamese population. But the flavors of the bayou are amply reflected in delta specialties ranging from po’boys to the concept’s signature, crawfish. The fusion doesn’t stop with Vietnamese dishes: Curry and other Indian influences are also evident. LA Crawfish describes the menu as “Asian Cajun.”",NA,3.1e+07,41.7,19,35.7,1900000,2018,"Yes"
"Vitality Bowls","The husband-wife team of Roy and Tara Gilad built this “superfood cafe” around customized acai bowls. They plan to open 28 locations in 2018 and 33 in 2019, says Tara Gilad. “Finding affordable real estate can be a challenge, but landlords like the fact that we’re a healthy concept,” she says. An expansion of delivery is in the cards, but ordering kiosks are not: Guest interaction is key to the mission, says Gilad, because staff often has to educate diners on the menu’s less familiar ingredients.","San Ramon, Calif.",4.5e+07,41.4,48,45.5,1200000,2018,"No"
"Gus’s World Famous Fried Chicken","Gus’s, one of the original hot fried chicken concepts, fueled its growth by trading on a 1953 family recipe. The menu star is the signature fried chicken, but Gus’s is also known for its Southern-style sides and pies. Service is fast casual, but decor is homey, with tables covered in checkered cloths. The restaurant has now expanded beyond its Memphis roots to 25 locations, extending to Texas, Michigan, Missouri, Maryland and California.","Mason, Tenn.",4.7e+07,40.1,24,26.3,2200000,2018,"Yes"
"California Fish Grill","The premise: sustainable seafood served in a laid-back atmosphere with a check average of $10. The menu is deliberately simple, offering about a dozen species of fish and shellfish, including scallops—a rarity at a fast casual—all sustainably sourced, says CEO Bob Holden. All 21 locations are in California, with four more to come in 2018. And in 2019, “We’re looking to get into Nevada, Colorado and Arizona,” Holden says, projecting a 20% to 30% growth rate. ","Fullerton, Calif.",4.7e+07,39.7,21,23.5,2600000,2018,"No"

"B.Good","Its tagline, “Food with roots,” reinforces B.Good’s ethos of local sourcing, farmer partnerships and sustainability. Although it’s positioned as a better-burger concept, the fast casual’s menu extends far beyond, offering a changing roster of seasonal salads and a large selection of kale and grain bowls. B.Good originated in Boston and began franchising in 2013; its 53 locations are now spread across 12 states as well as Canada, Germany and Switzerland.",NA,5e+07,38.9,53,32.5,1100000,2018,"Yes"
"Luna Grill","Suburban centers are the sweet spot for Luna Grill, says VP of Marketing Nicole Bushnell. The Mediterranean fast casual is concentrated in Southern California but recently opened its 45th restaurant, in Dallas, the eighth in that city. “We expect to have 50 locations by the end of summer,” she says. The Dallas store features a “brighter, more feminine, open-kitchen” prototype and an expanded menu that includes bowls, a plant-based burger and a full-bottle program for wine service.

"Yolk","This breakfast and lunch concept has locations in Illinois, Texas and Indiana, with plans to expand to Florida later
this year. New in 2018 is the opening of Yolk Test Kitchen in Chicago’s Wicker Park neighborhood. It’s a full-service restaurant offering Yolk’s staple items along with a
Test Kitchen menu section devoted to more unique specials, such as shakshouka, Korean hot chicken and waffles and Breakfast Mac & Cheese. Yolk tends to locate in urban areas, attracting a following of both locals and tourists. ",NA,2.9e+07,36.4,13,18.2,2400000,2018,"Yes"
"Burger Lounge","A demo-style kitchen, tabletops made from recycled water bottles and sustainable to-go packaging reinforce Burger Lounge’s eco-friendly, transparent message. Although other players in the crowded better-burger space also promote  sustainability, this fast casual promotes itself with the tagline “The original grass-fed burger.” Those burgers form the core of the menu, along with turkey, tuna and veggie burgers, salads, sides and shakes.

"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","“Unicorn casual” is how CEO Jeff Chandler describes Hopdoddy. “We transcend fast casual into a variation of casual dining. That makes us ‘rare,’” like a unicorn, he says. Chandler applies that uniqueness to growth as well. “We won’t stamp out identical cookie-cutter restaurants in every market,” he says, instead working with a prototype that can adapt to different sites. Hopdoddy is on pace to open one location a month through 2019, focusing on central Florida and the rest of the Southeast. ","Austin, Texas",4.9e+07,35.8,22,29.4,2500000,2018,"No"

Owner and co-founder Matt Fish says the chain is taking a break from expansion this year, but will pick back up again in 2019. Fish says Melt is also exploring out-of-state locations. “We’re looking at Pittsburgh and Detroit as two big markets that we want to break into,” he says. “That’s kind of the next four- to five-year plan.”  ","Lakewood, Ohio",2.1e+07,35,13,11.8,1700000,2018,"No"

The chain has expanded from its home state of Georgia into Florida and South Carolina and continues to develop its menu, recently rolling out veggie-forward options such as grilled portobello tacos.

"Blue Bottle Coffee","Blue Bottle Coffee began as a coffee roastery and retail company specializing in brewing its coffee at the peak time to achieve the best flavor. Blue Bottle remains a popular retail brand, but it has also expanded with cafes on both coasts as well as in Japan. The company has received more than $120 million in investment funding, which has helped it grow from a small indie brand into a major coffee player. That attracted the interest of Nestle, which acquired a 68% stake in the business last year.","Oakland, Calif.",2.7e+07,34.3,40,42.9,830000,2018,"No"
"Keke’s Breakfast Cafe","Serving scratch-made breakfast and lunch, Keke’s prepares meals using fresh ingredients, including produce that is delivered daily. The chain, which has locations throughout Florida, is expanding mostly through franchising, and is exploring traditional as well as nontraditional sites, recently opening a unit in a Whole Foods.

Consumers can stop in for weekly happy hours and special events, such as local brewery takeovers.

"Dig Inn","Farm-to-table is more than a catchphrase for this fast casual, which grows produce on its own 12-acre farm in upstate New York as well as working with more than 100 other farmers and food producers. “Mindful sourcing is our bread and butter,” the chain’s website states, noting that Dig Inn buys from minority-run and small-scale farms. Last year, after receiving $30 million in funding, Dig Inn expanded its brand with a two-story flagship unit in Manhattan called Dig House that features a MatchaBar window, serving a menu of drinks and pastries. ",NA,3e+07,32.6,19,18.8,1700000,2018,"No"

"Philz Coffee","Straying from the typical coffee shop menu, Philz does not serve specialty espresso beverages such as lattes or cappuccinos. Instead, baristas brew one cup of coffee at a time using a pour-over method that allows consumers to completely customize their order, living up to founder Phil Jaber’s philosophy that “The best coffee is the coffee that comes to your own personal taste.” The chain has received more than $75 million from investors, and it recently debuted a mobile app that lets customers order ahead. ",NA,2.1e+07,31.3,42,20,555000,2018,"No"

In addition to sourcing from individual growers, the chain holds an annual farmers market at each location.

The ever-changing menu focuses on on-trend, seasonal fare.

"Even Stevens Sandwiches","The sandwich shop is known for both what it dubs “craft-casual” fare as well as its charitable business model. For every sandwich sold, Even Stevens donates one sandwich to a local nonprofit. The chain is looking to grow where it has a built-in fanbase, asking guests where it should go next with a button on its website. As it grows, the chain has maintained its modern vibe through its voice (with sandwich names such as Mihami Vice) as well as by driving online ordering.",NA,2.3e+07,27.6,21,16.7,1200000,2018,"No"
"Burgerim","With 11 protein options for its burgers (including salmon, lamb, falafel and dry-aged beef), two patty sizes and a host of toppings, Burgerim—which increased its unit count by nearly 250% in 2018 to become the country's fastest-growing emerging chain—is upping the complexity of the traditional burger concept. The quick-service chain, which has now nearly 200 units (up from 80 in 2018) and another 350 in the ""active conception"" pipeline, is focusing on training and systems to ensure all those burger variations get executed properly, says Collette Kakuk, Burgerim's VP of marketing. Company executives recently embarked on a three-week system tour, visiting 65% of the company's units to reinforce training modules across the brand. Burgerim, which is largely franchisee-run, employs a team of franchise-business consultants to manage each trade area and work toward brand consistency, Kakuk says.

"110 Grill","How is 110 Grill thriving while other casual-dining chains falter? One point of differentiation for the Massachusetts-based concept is its focus on allergy-friendly dining. Everything on the restaurant's menu can be made gluten-free, and the chain caters to those with peanut allergies and other restrictions as well. ""Management runs every single allergy plate to the guest and ensures them it's safe to eat,"" says Ryan Dion, 110 Grill's COO, noting that 23% of the chain's business comes from diners with food allergies. In the kitchen, every station has an allergy-free space and, whenever possible, cross-contamination is minimized by limiting allergens. 110 Grill's breading mix, for example, is made with corn flour, which is gluten-free. Each unit (there are currently 22 locations, with eight more slated to open this year) features five distinct seating areas: a U-shaped bar, lounge, dining room, private dining area and patio.

Their line covered our store,"" says Kevin Hsu, the chain's CMO and one of its founders. ""It was kind of a slower start."" But people started peeking into the customizable poke bowl concept, and soon an online media outlet filmed a piece about the store's sushi burrito. The video got 50 million views on Facebook, Hsu says. Since then, the chain has been busy. Pokeworks units have worked to boost operational efficiency to decrease transaction time to 25 seconds during peak hours, Hsu says. The 42-unit chain also received a minority investment last year from Japanese foodservice company Toridoll to fuel its growth. And early this year, Pokeworks launched an app with a rewards program and order-ahead functionality.

The recent months have been busy ones for the plant-based chain, which focuses on unprocessed ingredients in its comfort food dishes. Last spring, By Chloe announced it had received $31 million from several capital funds, with plans to double its U.S. and international units. And this fall, the chain plans to open its first location with a redesigned back of house that employs space-saving equipment, giving the brand greater flexibility in its real estate selections, Hellstrand says.

It helps employees get to know diners and is part of the chain's mission of helping people, serving others and being part of the community, says CEO and co-founder Scott Moore. The fast-casual biscuit chain teaches all employees to make eye contact with guests and to try to connect with them. ""They're not just a number, they're our guest,"" Moore says. Before store leaders are hired at the company, prospective recruits must spend three days working in a store—including a Saturday—to see what the business is like.

"The Lost Cajun","The Lost Cajun, which had 24 units in 2018 and is slated to open 10 more units this year and more than a dozen in 2020, tries to stand out in the crowded casual-dining segment in a variety of ways. Unlike many well-known brands in the space, it focuses on Creole cuisine. Upon being seated, each diner is greeted with a wooden paddle stocked with six 2-ounce portions of the chain's most popular dishes. The samples frequently increase average check, founder Raymond Griffin says, as diners often add an extra portion of gumbo or bisque to their order. The family-friendly concept also allows kids to write on the walls and even the concrete floors with chalk while their parents sip ""porch wine."" And instead of full buildouts, units, which typically run 2,500 to 3,000 square feet, are often built into existing restaurant spaces. ""We like doing these conversions,"" Griffin says. ""There's a lot of restaurants that have tried in the last four or five years and have failed. ... A lot of the strip centers don't want another pizza or Mexican place.""","Frisco, Colo.",4.6e+07,58,24,50,2320000,2019,"Yes"
"Wahlburgers","""We are a celebrity concept, but it's matched with a chef-inspired menu,"" says Patrick Renna, who was named president of Wahlburgers in May after working as CFO and interim CEO at the burger chain for several years. The chain gets a publicity boost from the famous brothers (Paul, Donnie and Mark) and reality TV show behind the name; Paul is a chef who works full time for the brand. The concept, which is on track to open about 10 more units by year's end and an additional 15 to 20 stores in 2020, recently partnered with the Hy-Vee supermarket chain to open 26 units in seven states as well as offering Wahlburgers items at the grocery store's Market Grille locations. Wahlburgers is also expanding its retail beef line, currently available in 4,000 supermarkets.

"Bibibop Asian Grill","Veteran restaurateur Charley Shin, founder of Charleys Philly Steaks, is behind this Columbus, Ohio-based fast-casual concept, which launched in 2013. Bibibop serves health-focused, customizable Asian bowls with a variety of proteins and toppings. In addition to its restaurant sales, the chain has a robust build-your-own, buffet-style catering program for groups from 12 to 200.

"Bulla Gastrobar","Tapas concept Bulla Gastrobar (pronounced ""boo-ya"") is finding success in introducing the Spanish style of small-plates dining to American audiences. The growing concept, which frequently adds seasonal plates and cocktails, focuses on the social aspect of dining—though it also offers delivery through several third-party providers.

"Flower Child","Fox Restaurant Concepts opened its first Flower Child in 2014 with the mission of ""delivering healthy food for a happy world."" Although the fast casual has a decidedly hippy vibe, its model for growth is big business. To power that growth, Flower Child received an investment from The Cheesecake Factory in 2016, providing capital and resources for expansion.

"Slapfish","The first brick-and-mortar Slapfish sprung from a food truck in 2011. It was built in Huntington Beach, Calif., close to the source for its sustainable, seafood-centric menu. Chef-founder Andrew Gruel positioned it as ""a modern seafood shack"" with the goal of getting Americans to eat more fish by serving quality product in an unintimidating fast-casual setting. He created an accessible menu of fish tacos, sandwiches and lobster and shrimp rolls, plus introduced novel items such as chowder fries. Excellent customer service was also part of Slapfish's DNA from the get-go, with an emphasis on advancement.

"Your Pie","Although Your Pie claims to have launched the fast-casual pizza category 10 years ago, its growth hasn't accelerated nearly as quickly as front-runners Blaze Pizza and MOD Pizza. Both landed among the top five fastest-growing brands on Restaurant Business' 2015 Future 50 list, at Nos. 2 and 5, respectively.

"The Pizza Press","The inspiration behind this customizable pizza concept is the 1920s-era newspaper and its role as the foundation of American communities. The Pizza Press' menu and marketing carry out this theme, as customers are encouraged to ""publish"" their own pizzas from an array of ingredients or choose a signature pie named after a major American newspaper. These include The Herald (white sauce, mozzarella, grilled chicken, ricotta, grape tomatoes, red onion, mushrooms and basil) and The Tribune (red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, red onion, mushroom, roasted peppers, Italian sausage, olives and ricotta). The fast casual also sports an upgraded beverage list offering cold-brew coffee, sodas, beer and wine along with the usual fountain drinks.

"Blue Bottle Coffee","Blue Bottle moved up the rankings in 2018, going from No. 38 in last year's Future 50 to No. 16 this year. No doubt that ascent had to do with Nestle's acquisition of 68% of the coffee cafe in September 2017, providing capital to power growth.

The concept added three stores in 2018, and sales surged by almost 42% year over year. But unlike its competitors, this brand's future expansion plans include a foray into the grocery segment.

"Willie Jewell's Old School Bar-B-Q","With its home base in South Carolina, Willie Jewell's is all about authentic barbecue, slow-smoked on-site and cut to order. But while the cooking process takes time, the service model is fast casual, getting the meaty sandwiches, salads and platters to customers quickly and efficiently. Sides and desserts reflect the concept's roots as well, with items such as fried okra, corn fritters, collard greens, peach cobbler and banana pudding.

Chef-founder Mike Johnson’s menu includes smoked pulled pork, ribs, housemade sausage, salmon, turkey, brisket and even portobellos, all crafted into signature sandwiches, salads and more.

"Famous Toastery","Toastery is a made-up word, so it always comes up first in Google searches, says Robert Maynard, co-founder of the full-service breakfast and lunch concept. Coining that name was just one of the smart moves he and his partner, Brian Burchill, made five years after they founded what started as Toast Cafe in 2005. ""There were lots of other Toast Cafes, so we had difficulty getting a trademark,"" Maynard says. The duo soon found themselves pioneering other trends: In 2008, they introduced all-day breakfast, and in 2009, avocado toast. After growing to three locations, Famous Toastery decided to give franchising a shot in 2014.","Charlotte, N.C.",4.2e+07,38.5,32,28,1500000,2019,"Yes"
"Duck Donuts","While it once relied more on organic growth, the made-to-order doughnut brand is getting more deliberate about its strategy for expansion. ""We're becoming more intentional about our growth,"" founder Russ DiGilio told Restaurant Business earlier this year. The 12-year-old concept has found that it does particularly well in tourist areas—both year-round and seasonal spots. ""Both those markets show tremendous return on investment,"" said DiGilio, in part because the doughnut-making process takes place in front of the guests, creating an entertaining experience.","Mechanicsburg, Pa.",3.2e+07,38.5,80,37.9,470000,2019,"Yes"
"Apple Spice","The sandwich-and-salad brand is ahead of many of its competitors when it comes to catering: It first opened in 1988 as a box-lunch delivery and catering company.

"Slater's 50/50","The burger chain launched in Southern California with its signature patty made with 50% beef and 50% bacon. The full-service concept has since expanded its menu beyond its bacon-y burger, promoting options such as a vegan mushroom-based burger—which it ran as a ""Battle of the Burgers"" LTO against its 50/50 Shroomin Burger—signature beers developed in collaboration with breweries and outrageous shakes designed for Instagram at select locations.

It?s thinking about a boutique hotel, along with possible smaller venues, CEO Robert Thompson told Restaurant Business earlier this year.

To further expand its offerings beyond signature and customizable thin-crust pizzas, the chain recently added on-trend Roman-style pizzas for a thicker-crust option. But it's the dough—made from a 100-year-old recipe fresh in-house using a fork-style mixer—that sets the chain apart.

"Honeygrow","Following a period of fast growth and heavy interest from the investor community, Honeygrow has slowed its expansion. The fast casual announced last winter that it planned to shutter several of its Chicago locations as it struggled with high rent costs and scaling its employee training and other operations. ""We'll use 2019 to clean this up and take a step back and focus on the operators and on the training,"" CEO Justin Rosenberg previously told Restaurant Business.

About 60% of customers build their own, while the rest choose from &pizza's ""Hits,"" CEO Michael Lastoria told Eater Boston earlier this year.

"Mendocino Farms","Adolescence has been kind to Mendocino Farms, the high-end fast-casual sandwich concept that turned the industry's head while in the startup stage. Featuring high-caliber sandwiches abounding in fresh ingredients, the brainchild of a California husband-and-wife team generated high volumes and a loyal following. Then Big Corporate stepped forward with a bulging sack of money. TPG Capital, the private-equity behemoth that once owned Burger King, bought the concept from co-founders Mario Del Pero and Ellen Chen and their backer, the smaller private-equity whale L Catterton. Del Pero was replaced as CEO by a seasoned chain builder, Harald Herrmann, most recently of Darden Restaurants. Competitors wondered if corporatism would wreck the boutique-y brand. But after about two years inside the TPG fold, the modern-day Mendocino seems indistinguishable from its entrepreneurial form. Instead of cranking out units, the TPG-owned chain has added only about 10 stores, and sales appear to be as strong as ever.",NA,3.8e+07,31.1,24,41.2,1875000,2019,"No"
"Ahipoki Bowl","Scottsdale, Ariz., businessmen Jason Jantzen and Michael Zimmerman wanted to offer their fellow Arizonans the caliber of poke a discerning diner might find in California or Hawaii. The result is Ahipoki Bowl, a fast casual that plays up the type of raw fish that's featured (hence the ahi). The prototype drew enough of a following to fuel its expansion to about 30 units, but Jantzen and Zimmerman are hedging their bets with a second concept featuring brisket.","Hollywood, Calif.",3.3e+07,31,28,16.7,1270000,2019,"No"

"Roti Modern Mediterranean","One of the earlier entrants in the Mediterranean fast-casual market, Roti is striving to differentiate itself within that now-crowded field with some service-streamlining technology. The chain is installing kiosks where patrons can input as highly customized of an order as they desire. If they want to save additional time, they can make their selection en route to the restaurant via Roti's app. When the food is ready, the customer is alerted as to which door on a wall of shuttered cubbies to open for the fare. The setup is a knockoff of the serving system that generated reams of publicity a few years ago for a now derailed concept called Eatsa. Instead of selling sandwiches and salads, Eatsa turned into more of a technology company following an infusion of cash from private-equity firm Valor Equity Partners.

"The Flying Biscuit Cafe","Don't confuse this onetime sister of Moe's Southwest Grill with the fast-casual biscuit concepts popping up in Tennessee and elsewhere in the South. Yes, biscuits are a specialty of the brand, along with grits. But the full-service breakfast and lunch operation is more akin to a Denny's with a heavy Southern accent. Specialties include modern riffs on diner-style foods, such as Oven Fried Green Tomatoes, Not Your Mama's Pimento Cheese Sandwich, Organic Oatmeal Pancakes and Southern Style Biscuit Benedict. Alcoholic beverages also figure into the menu. Breakfast is the Biscuit's specialty, but the former holding of multiconcept franchisor Raving Brands adheres to no daypart boundaries.

Arooga's aims for sports-loving families, balancing accessibility (more than 80 menu items under $8.99, TVs showing women's sports along with the usual male-focused fare) with a dash of the upscale. Customers can still have their wings, but the choice extends to a meatless version. Ditto for the nachos, chili cheese fries, brats and chili: Each is available in a plant-based form. The promise is a better dining experience—""Our housemade food is prepared by chefs instead of factory workers,"" boasts the website—with the traditional strengths of a sports bar.

But the concept also offers a subscription plan of five, 10, 15 or 21 meals, with prices that vary according to the volume, from $7.60 to $6.10 per meal. The meal plans, priced at $38 through $128 in the aggregate, provide the ""balance of protein, carbs and fats"" that a formal nutritional plan would provide, without the fuss and inconvenience of having to cook, says the Clean Eatz website.

Fifteen-year-old Cafe Zupas assures consumers it's stuck to that model. All the soups, salads and sandwiches are made from scratch, down to the dressings and garnishes. The nearly 60-unit chain describes its kitchen as ""open-source"" and ""intentionally transparent,"" or what a full-service rival might call a display kitchen.

The hot dog and burger chain offers both Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods on its menu—it serves an Impossible Burger, for instance, and Beyond Sausage. It is also looking to grow using ghost kitchens. The fast-casual chain signed on to the off-premise-only startup Kitchen United, with plans to open in 25 of those locations by the end of next year. While many will be in markets where Dog Haus doesn't have a presence, the company believes it can be used to test the concept before expanding.","Pasadena, Calif.",3e+07,26,35,12.9,925000,2019,"Yes"

In this case, however, that executive was Chris Dahlander, a former marketing director for Brinker International who wanted to provide more nutritious meals for people on the go.

But it has doubled its units every year since, acquiring Garden Bar, another Pacific Northwest-based salad chain, last year. January and February brought the chain's best sales ever, co-CEO Tom Small said, before the 27-unit brand was forced to shut down because of the coronavirus.
